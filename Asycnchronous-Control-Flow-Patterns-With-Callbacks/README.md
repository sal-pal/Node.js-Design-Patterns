In this chapter, we use the example of a web spider to demonstrate good practices and design patterns
in node.js. The web spider takes a url as input and downloads its contents locally onto a file. Keep in 
mind that the example changes with each script, so if you have any question please refer to the desciption 
at the top of the script or revisit this README file.


Enjoy!
